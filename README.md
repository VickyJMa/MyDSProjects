- 🎯 This file contains my experience on utilizing machine learning models in anomaly detection. 
- 🧩 Feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are important steps before utilizing any machine learning model on your dataset. 
- ⛳️ Models I used include simple decision tree, GBM, deep learning, HBOS, ECOD, PCA, KNN, random forest, isolate forest, etc.
